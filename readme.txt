ðŸŽ¯ What is readmission?
In medical terms, readmission means a patient who has been discharged from a hospital is admitted again within a certain period. In your dataset, this is defined in the readmitted column:

readmitted value	Meaning
<30	Patient readmitted within 30 days
>30	Patient readmitted after 30 days
NO	Patient not readmitted
ðŸ¤– What is the model predicting?
You're using machine learning classification models to predict:

Will this diabetic patient be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of their discharge?

This is a binary classification task, where:

1 (Positive Class) = Readmitted within 30 days (<30)

0 (Negative Class) = Not readmitted (>30 or NO)
